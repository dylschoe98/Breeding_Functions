# Breeding Functions

This repository contains a set of general functions for use when working with data commonly obtained in plant breeding programs. A set of funcitons are focused on analysis and quality control of multi-environment (MET) data, including but not limited to calculating correlations between replicates (or blocks) and environments. A function is included to conduct a stage 1 analysis as part of a 2 stage model for analysis of highly unbalanced MET data. Finally, functions are included to automate mixed-model analysis.

An additional set of functions are included to condcut genomic selection and GWAS analyses. These including calculating minor allele frequency (MAF) 
conducting cross-validation (CV) for genomic prediciton (GP).
